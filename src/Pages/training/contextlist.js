        string:"This project focuses on the serious game design for training offshore wind turbine maintenance personnel. The objective is to address the high costs and risks associated with training maintenance personnel in the offshore wind energy industry. Maintenance personnel in offshore wind power operations often confront adverse conditions such as high altitudes and pressures, frequently facing dangers that could lead to fatalities or severe injuries. This project allows maintenance workers for offshore wind turbines to undergo training using computers or mobile devices. In addition to significantly reducing training costs, increasing the frequency of practice sessions also enhances the safety of actual wind turbine operations."

        key:"introduce_2",
        string:"We mixed the participatory design and agile design methodologies in the project. Given the uniqueness and high-risk nature of the offshore wind turbine maintenance industry, it is crucial to ensure the active involvement of users and experts in the design process. An agile design framework is utilized, with iteration, rapid feedback, and interdisciplinary team collaboration as core principles for development. Iteration occurs not only during game prototype testing but is applied throughout various stages, including early process diagrams, sample drawings, game content design, and prototype development, using short-cycle meetings to achieve efficient, flexible, and reliable outcomes.",

        key:"method",
        string:"In participatory design, although it allows for diverse opinions to be heard, the drawback often highlighted is the high resource and time costs, making it one of the most frequently mentioned flaws in past participatory design cases and even a potential factor leading to project failure. The advantage of agile design methods lies in the ability to better assess the feasibility of output concepts before investing significant time and resources. This efficiency enables effective time and resource cost savings. Moreover, with the involvement of experts in the design team, agile design methods help prevent major errors in professional domains resulting from rapid iterations.",

Through three observations, the first instance involved non-participatory observation to understand the overall teaching methods and context of the curriculum. The second and third observations, on the other hand, included participatory observation, where researchers actively engaged in the course activities, gaining firsthand experience to delve into the teaching content and identify learning challenges.",

Expert interviews focused on curriculum learning objectives, assessment criteria, common mistakes by trainees, and potential maintenance scenarios. User interviews aimed to capture learners' sentiments about the course, identify learning challenges, and assess their specific needs. By directly engaging with actual users, the goal was to comprehend their learning experiences, expectations, and suggestions regarding the serious game, ensuring alignment with user expectations and needs in the game development process.",

The research employed participatory design and agile design methodologies, conducting routine meetings on a weekly basis for rapid iterations and adjustments. This approach allowed for flexible exploration of different solutions and the identification of potential issues in the early stages of game design. Attendees at these meetings included members leading the game design within the research team, as well as experts in offshore wind energy, power system maintenance education, design experts, supervisors, and users.",

Wireframes serve as tools to facilitate quick communication among team members from different domains during meetings. Once the wireframes are confirmed, we moved on to create the mockups. We used simple screen compositions with images sourced from the internet to adjust the visuals and style before prototype development began.",

The design team would make adjustments based on expert recommendations before user testing. The design team provided paper versions of the game screens for experts to directly draw or modify, and oral and graphical records were analyzed and applied for rapid adjustments before user testing.",
